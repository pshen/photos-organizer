# photos-organizer

## Problem
I have many photos taken by cameras, mobile phones. There is no good photos organizer tool to automatically copy the files to proper folder/subphotos.

Lightroom is good, but not cheap. Apple Photos Library is free, but hard to understand the file structure within the application folder.

I want to create a small python script, which can read exif data from photo files and move them to auto-created folders (by date).

Ideally
YYYY/MM-DD

## Idea
A tool named exiftool seems to be very useful, which supports many photo formats (jpg, raw)
